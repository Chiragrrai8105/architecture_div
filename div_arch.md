# This is a custom build object detection architecture using some major dependencies

# Start with backbone

Define the Purpose of Your Backbone

**Edges → early layers**

**Shapes → middle layers**

**Object parts → deeper layers**


## Conv2D → BatchNorm → Activation (ReLU)


# In basic words 

the div takes the raw image in 640x640 and sends it inside the multiple layer transforms it into feature maps.
The shapes and textures of bacterial colonies
Their positions and edges
Lighting and contrast patterns

## STRUCTURE OVERVIEW

Your custom backbone is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) composed of:

**Conv blocks — basic feature extractors**

**Residual connections — to stabilize deep learning**

**Downsampling layers — to reduce spatial size, increase channel depth**

**Multi-scale outputs — for detecting small, medium, and large colonies**

## STEP 1: CONVOLUTIONAL BLOCK

Conv2D extracts spatial patterns (edges, blobs, shapes).

BatchNorm normalizes the output for stable training.

ReLU introduces non-linearity (helps model learn complex features).

## STEP 2: RESIDUAL BLOCK .

### A Residual Block allows the network to skip some layers and add the input directly to the output.

This helps:

Prevent vanishing gradients

Improve training stability

Allow deeper networks to learn effectively

## STEP 3: BACKBONE STRUCTURE (Layer by Layer)

### You built the MyBackbone class using the ConvBlock and ResidualBlock.

## STEP 4: FEATURE MAPS AND SIZES

| Stage | Layer             | Output Size | Channels | Purpose          |
| ----- | ----------------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| 1     | Conv(3→32)        | 320×320     | 32       | Basic edges      |
| 2     | Conv + Residual   | 160×160     | 64       | Texture patterns |
| 3     | Conv + 2×Residual | 80×80       | 128      | Colony shapes    |
| 4     | Conv + 2×Residual | 40×40       | 256      | Medium colonies  |
| 5     | Conv + 2×Residual | 20×20       | 512      | Large colonies   |

## STEP 5: TESTING THE BACKBONE

You tested your backbone with a sample tensor:

'''bash

x = torch.randn(1, 3, 640, 640)
model = MyBackbone()
f3, f4, f5 = model(x)

print(f3.shape)  # torch.Size([1, 128, 80, 80])
print(f4.shape)  # torch.Size([1, 256, 40, 40])
print(f5.shape)  # torch.Size([1, 512, 20, 20])

'''

| ------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Early layers | Edges, gradients      | Petri dish boundaries, background edges |
| Mid layers   | Shapes, curves        | Circular colony patterns                |
| Deep layers  | High-level structures | Colony clusters, overlapping regions    |
